## How to use

1. Login
  - The first panel is the login page. The panel enables user to login or signup into the chatroom.
  - ![login-panel](readme/panel/login.png)<br>
2. Main page
  - The second panel is the main page. It enables users to do the following functions in the app.
  - ![main-page](readme/panel/main.png)<br>

### Function description

- Profile/Change name function

### Firebase page link

- [Your web page `URL`](https://assign2react.web.app)

### Others (Optional)

- I thought that props was hard but it was easier than I thought and surprisingly convenient.
- This assignment is harder than I thought. The main reason is that if the components are designed badly, things get messed up.
- Why are the firebase manuals sooooo messed up? Many of the functions are not so clearly explained or the examples cannot even run. Many examples tried pop error messages concerning that the function does not exist.
